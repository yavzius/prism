  title: "Concept explainers and educational visuals",
  content: `Create an educational visual explanation with the clarity and beauty of a Bartosz Ciechanowski interactive essay or a New York Times data graphic. The goal: someone looks at this for 10 seconds and understands the concept.

CANVAS: Warm off-white (#F5F3EE) with a subtle paper texture — not flat digital white. The warmth makes it inviting rather than clinical.

CENTRAL CONCEPT: The main subject sits prominently in the upper third of the canvas, large enough to anchor everything. It should feel important — rendered with care, with enough visual detail to be recognizable but not cluttered.

EXPLANATORY STRUCTURE: Choose the layout that fits the concept:
- Process: A flowing S-curve or left-to-right path with numbered waypoints. Each step is a small illustrated node connected by gentle curved arrows.
- Structure: An annotated diagram with thin callout lines extending to labeled explanations in the margins. The callout lines bend once (not twice), have small circle terminators, and connect to text blocks with a bold label + brief description.
- Comparison: Side by side panels with a shared axis or mirrored layout.
- Layers: Stacked planes with slight vertical offset, showing how components build on each other.

COLOR: Restrained. 3 colors maximum plus warm grays. One dominant color for the main subject. One secondary for process arrows and connectors. One warm accent for the key insight or "aha" moment — this is the thing you want the viewer to remember. Example palette: slate (#4A5568) for structure, sage (#6B9080) for flow, burnt sienna (#C2714F) for the key point.

TYPOGRAPHY: Three levels.
1. A framing question or title at the top — bold, 24-28px. Tells the viewer what they're learning.
2. Component labels — medium weight, 16px, placed close to what they describe.
3. Annotation text — regular, 12px, muted color. 1-2 lines max. Adds nuance without competing.

VISUAL LANGUAGE: Use gentle curved arrows (not straight lines) for cause-and-effect. Number steps inside small colored circles. Dotted lines for optional or implicit relationships. Small icons or simple illustrations where they genuinely help comprehension — not decoration.

COMPOSITION: 30% whitespace. Group related elements by proximity, not bounding boxes. The eye should flow naturally from the title through the main concept to the supporting details. The bottom of the image contains the outcome or takeaway.

The overall feel: authoritative but warm. Like a great teacher drew this on a nice whiteboard to explain something they love.`,
