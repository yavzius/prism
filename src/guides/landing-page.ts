  content: `Design a landing page with the confidence and craft of the best indie SaaS sites — think Linear, Resend, Clerk, or Vercel's product pages. Not a template. Not a Canva export. A page with opinion.

HERO SECTION: Full viewport. The headline is the hero — set it large (56-72px), bold, tight letter-spacing (-0.03em). Use a display typeface with character: something geometric and modern, not just "sans-serif." Below: a single line of subtext in 18px, muted, max 60 characters. One CTA button — pill-shaped, in the accent color, with generous padding. The background should have depth: either a subtle mesh gradient, a large blurred product screenshot, or an abstract geometric pattern in muted tones. A minimal nav bar: logo left, 3-4 links, sign-up button right.

TRUST BAR: A horizontal strip of 5-6 partner or press logos in monochrome. Small, muted, credible. 60px tall.

FEATURES: Show features in a modular layout — not a boring 3-column icon grid. Try: alternating spotlight rows where a product screenshot takes 60% of the width and text sits beside it, flipping sides each row. Or: a Bento-style grid where feature cards have different sizes based on importance. Each card: an icon or small illustration, a bold title, 2 lines of description. No fluff.

SOCIAL PROOF: Light warm background section. 2-3 testimonial cards with real-sounding quotes, names, titles, and avatar photos. Below: 3 key metrics in large bold type ("10K+ teams", "99.9% uptime", "4.8 rating") with small labels beneath.

CTA SECTION: A final conversion block. Can be a gradient banner with a headline and button, or a simple centered text block with a clear ask. The tone shifts from informational to direct.

FOOTER: Dark charcoal background. 3-4 columns of links in small type. Social icons. Copyright line. Clean and compact.

COLOR: One brand color + one accent + warm neutrals. Not safe corporate blue unless the brand demands it. Consider: deep indigo (#312E81), warm coral (#E06C4F), forest green (#2D6A4F), or rich plum (#7C3AED). The accent pops on CTAs and key elements. Sections alternate between white and warm light gray (#F8F6F3) for rhythm.

TYPOGRAPHY: Maximum two typefaces — one display/heading font with personality, one clean body font. Headings: bold, tight. Body: regular weight, comfortable line-height, muted color. Numbers and stats in a slightly different weight or style for emphasis.

SPATIAL RHYTHM: Sections breathe. 80-120px between major sections. 32px between elements within sections. The page has a clear vertical rhythm. 30%+ whitespace. Nothing feels crammed.

The overall feel: the landing page of a product you'd actually want to use. Opinionated, polished, alive.`,
