  title: "Overlap and set diagrams",
  content: `A beautiful data graphic from a magazine spread — the overlap IS the insight, rendered with the luminosity of watercolor meeting light. Not a textbook set diagram. Something closer to a Pentagram data visualization or a quality annual report where the color blending itself communicates.

CANVAS: A warm, nearly white surface — cream or the palest warm gray (#FAF9F6). Kept neutral and quiet so the translucent circles own the visual field entirely.

CIRCLES: Large, generous, and substantially overlapping — the intersections should be wide zones, not slivers. This is where the meaning lives, so give it room. Each circle fills at about 40-45% opacity with a subtle radial gradient: lighter at the center, more saturated at the edges, producing a soft luminous quality rather than a flat wash. Use a confident palette — a rich blue (#3B82F6), an emerald (#10B981), and if three circles, a warm amber. The strokes are slightly deeper versions of each fill. Where circles overlap, the colors blend naturally: blue meeting green produces a teal-cyan; green meeting amber yields a warm olive; the center convergence of all three creates a darker, richer tone. This color mixing is the diagram's visual payoff — let it happen beautifully.

LABELS: Circle names sit outside and slightly above each circle in semibold text, colored to match their circle's stroke. Inside the exclusive regions, items are listed vertically in regular-weight dark text — brief, two to four words each. Overlap regions carry their items on small frosted white pill backgrounds so text stays legible against the blended colors. The center intersection — the universal overlap — gets the most visual emphasis: slightly larger text, semibold, on a more prominent pill. Every region must be labeled. An unlabeled intersection is wasted space.

LAYOUT: Two circles sit side by side, overlapping by about a third of their diameter, centered on the canvas. Three circles arrange in the classic triangular formation — two above, one below and centered — each overlapping its neighbors generously. The cluster of circles is centered with wide margins. Thirty percent of the canvas breathes.

TYPOGRAPHY: The title anchors the top in bold, dark text. Circle names are semibold in their respective colors. Region items are regular or medium weight in dark tones. An optional insight line in italic below the diagram can summarize the key takeaway. Maximum three circles — beyond that, overlaps become unparseable. The center overlap is the hero; place the most surprising shared element there.

The overall feel: the surprise is in the intersection.`,
