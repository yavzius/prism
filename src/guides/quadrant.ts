  content: `Create a 2x2 quadrant matrix with the strategic clarity of a BCG growth-share diagram or a well-designed consultancy strategy slide — the kind of framework where spatial position IS the argument.

CANVAS: A warm off-white (#F3F0EB) with subtle texture. The quadrant sits centered with generous margins on all sides — at least a quarter of the canvas is breathing room. The matrix should feel like a considered object, not a screenshot of a spreadsheet.

THE AXES: Two intersecting lines centered on the canvas, dividing the space into four equal zones. Clean, confident lines in dark charcoal (#2D2D2D) with small arrowheads at their positive ends. Each axis labeled at both extremes in muted type — the dimension names that define the framework. The axes are the skeleton; everything else hangs on them.

QUADRANT ZONES: Each zone gets a soft, translucent background wash — not saturated blocks, but gentle tints that code the space without overwhelming the items plotted within. Warm rose for the low-value zone (bottom-left), pale amber for the high-risk zone (top-left), soft blue-gray for the opportunistic zone (bottom-right), and pale sage green for the high-value zone (top-right). Each quadrant carries an action-oriented label in its far corner — "Invest," "Question," "Harvest," "Avoid" or whatever fits the framework — in a slightly darker shade of its zone color. These labels name the strategic implication of being in that space.

PLOTTED ITEMS: Labeled dots — filled circles with a short name sitting just to the right or above. The dot color contrasts with its zone's wash: a deep confident blue (#2B4A7C) for most items, with a warm accent (#C4593B) for any that deserve special attention. Keep to four or five items per quadrant maximum. Crowding destroys the whole point — each item's position in the space IS the insight, and it needs room to be individually readable.

TYPOGRAPHY: The matrix title centered above in bold with real character. Axis labels at the extremes in muted, compact type. Zone names in bold, tucked into their corners. Item labels are small and precise — they identify, they don't narrate.

The overall feel: decisions made visible — the spatial position IS the insight.`,
