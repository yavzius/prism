  content: `Create a before/after comparison with the dramatic clarity of a product redesign case study from a top portfolio — the kind of transformation you feel before you read a single word. Two halves, one story: decline on the left, resolution on the right.

CANVAS: A warm, lightly textured surface (#F5F3EF) with the softness of matte paper. Both panels sit on this surface as cards with gentle rounded corners and the faintest shadow — present enough to float, restrained enough to stay quiet.

COLOR TEMPERATURE: This is the core trick. The "Before" half lives in desaturated, cool tones — faded grays, muted slate, low contrast. It should feel dated or troubled without being ugly. The "After" half shifts warm and vibrant: crisp whites, bold accent color, high contrast, sharp edges. A confident accent — electric blue (#3B82F6) or a vivid teal — appears only on the After side. The temperature shift alone tells the story before the viewer reads anything.

LAYOUT: A vertical divider splits the canvas. Both halves show the same subject at the same scale in the same position — structural mirroring is everything. The viewer's eye should flick between left and right and catch every difference instantly. Differences live in quality, density, and visual treatment, never in arrangement. A small badge centered on the divider names the transformation in one word: "Redesigned," "Optimized," "Refactored." Bold "BEFORE" in muted gray tops the left panel; "AFTER" in the accent color tops the right.

CONTRAST DETAILS: The Before side carries the weight of its problems visibly — cluttered elements, tangled connections, faded colors, perhaps a warning badge or two. The After side feels resolved: clean alignment, clear hierarchy, breathing room, success indicators where problems used to be. Give the After panel a subtle depth treatment — the faintest extra shadow — so it feels elevated. Literally and figuratively better.

METRIC CALLOUTS: Along the divider, two or three metric pairs show the quantitative shift. Old value in small muted gray, an arrow in the accent color, new value bold and larger in dark charcoal (#1F2937). "450ms" faded and small, arrow, "12ms" crisp and confident. These catch the eye naturally during the left-right scan.

TYPOGRAPHY: The subject title sits above the split — bold, dark, centered, authoritative. The BEFORE/AFTER labels are bold uppercase with generous letter-spacing, sized to orient without dominating. Metric callouts use size contrast to dramatize the improvement. Internal labels within each half stay consistent and clean, serving the comparison rather than competing with it.

The overall sensibility: the improvement is visceral — you feel it before you understand it. The After side doesn't just look better; it looks inevitable, like the Before was always waiting to become this.`,
