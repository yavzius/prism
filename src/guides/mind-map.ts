  content: `A talented designer's Miro board at peak brainstorm — captured energy, organized chaos. Not a structured concept map. A mind map should feel organic, playful, and slightly imperfect, like a beautifully illustrated sketchnote from a conference talk.

CANVAS: Soft cream (#FBF9F4) with an optional faint radial gradient darkening at the edges to pull the eye inward. The surface should feel warm and inviting — a wall you'd want to pin things to.

CENTER: The central topic is the largest, boldest node — dead center, filled with deep charcoal (#2D2D2D) or dark navy, white text, a confident shadow. This is the gravitational anchor. Everything else orbits it.

BRANCHES: Four to six primary branches radiate outward at roughly equal angles, like spokes of a wheel. Each branch gets its own vivid color — coral, teal (#2EC4B6), golden amber, soft purple, moss green — saturated but warm, never neon. Connections are thick near the center and taper to thin at the leaves, curving organically with no sharp angles. Where a branch forks, the split feels smooth and natural, like a tree limb dividing. Sub-branches inherit their parent's color at reduced saturation, creating a visual fade as ideas become more specific.

NODES: The central topic is bold and large with a filled background. Primary branches are medium-large in bold text with colored fills matching their branch. Sub-branches step down in size and weight, using lighter fills or outlines. Leaf ideas are the smallest — just text with a subtle underline or a tiny circular badge. Node shapes vary to keep things lively: the center is a bold rounded form, primary branches use pills or soft rectangles, leaves are minimal. Small geometric icons — a lightbulb, a gear, a star, a question mark — sit beside key nodes to add visual variety and aid recall. Keep them supplementary, not dominant.

LAYOUT: True radial burst. The overall silhouette should feel roughly circular or slightly organic-blobby, never lopsided. Each primary branch spawns two to four sub-branches that spread outward, staggering at different radial distances to avoid collision. The map fills about seventy percent of the canvas, with breathing room at every edge. No branch should feel cramped — if two start to collide, curve them apart.

The overall feel: creative energy, captured and organized — something you'd want to pin on a wall.`,
